# Property Accessors for C++
*Developed in a fugue state by Evan Balster, January 2025*

This is a header-only library implementing zero-overhead **property accessors** â€” that is, entities that look like variables but are actually just a `get()` and/or `set(...)` function in disguise.

Property accessors are commonly used to make members of one class look like members of another class that refers to it, or to provide multiple mutable representations of the same information.  This syntactic sugar is a popular feature of other high-level languages such as C# but sadly hasn't been accepted into standard C++.

<mark>**The API is a work-in-progress and subject to change.**</mark>

### Features

* **Zero memory overhead**.
* **Zero runtime overhead** when compiled with optimization.
* **Proxy property accessors** based on reference expressions, for concealing indirection.
* **Value property accessors** based on "get" and/or "set" expressions, for alternative representations of data.
* **Type emulation** allows properties to behave almost exactly like member variables.
  * **Class member access** via `->`, or via `.` member access using a `mimic` specialization.
  * **Full operator support**, behaving as if the property accessor were replaced by value.
  * **Full const-correctness support**.


## Core Concept: Proxy Accessors

Proxy property accessors are based on a **reference getter** that returns an lvalue reference to some value or object.  This reference may be const.  Here's a working example:

```c++
struct actual_data_t {Object *object;}

struct getter_x : actual_data_t
{
    int& get() const {return object->x;}
};

using accessor_x = property_accessor<getter_x>;
```

These are useful for making something look like a member of your class when it's actually part of another object.  This can help to make code more concise without adding redundant references to your objects.

For the most part, a proxy accessor can be treated like a variable of reference type identical to what is returned by `get`.

## Core Concept: Value Accessors

Value property accessors are based on a **value getter** function and optional **value setter** function.

```c++
struct actual_data_t {int x;}

struct getter_negative_x : actual_data_t
{
    int get() const          {return -x;}
    void set(int negative_x) {x = -negative_x;}
};

using accessor_x = property_accessor<getter_x>;
```

These are useful for exposing multiple representations of data â€” for example, representing an angle in both degrees and radians.  They can be used to encapsulate the real representation of your data so it can be changed later on.

For the most part, a value accessor works like a regular variable of the getter's return type â€” except that access by reference is not possible (because a copy of the value is made whenever it is read).  If the value is settable, it supports compound assignments and incrementations as well as modification of mimicked members by making a temporary copy behind the scenes.

## Example

Here is a contrived example using both proxy and value access.  Suppose we want a nicer interface to this bare-bones data structure:

```c++
struct Rect
{
    int x1, x2, y1, y2;
    
    int area() const    {return (x2-x1) * (y2-y1);}
};
```

Using this library we can create a manipulator class called **Virtual_Rect** which provides read-write access to a rectangle's corner coordinates as well as its `width` and `height`, and a read-only `area` property.  Its memory layout will consist of just a single pointer `Rect*`, but these properties will act like real member variables.

Property accessors are declared in a "block", together with the underlying variables.  This block is in fact a union where every data member has the same layout.  We can use the handy `PropertyAccessors` macro to hide away the details:

```c++
#include <property_accessor.h>

struct Virtual_Rect
{
    struct RectPtr {Rect *rect;};

    //
    PropertyAccessors(RectPtr,
                      
        // Give the real RectPtr structure a name so we can assign to it.
        UnionMember(RectPtr rect_ptr;),
    
        // Proxy (reference) property accessors
        Proxy  (int,  x1,     rect->x1),
        Proxy  (int,  x2,     rect->x2),
        Proxy  (int,  y1,     rect->y1),
        Proxy  (int,  y2,     rect->y2),
                    
        // Value (get/set by copy) property accessors
        GetSet (int,  width,  rect->x2 - rect->x1,
                int new_width,           rect->x2 = rect->x1 + new_width),
        GetSet (int,  height, rect->y2 - rect->y1,
                int new_height,          rect->y2 = rect->y1 + new_height),
        GetOnly(int,  area,   rect->area())

   );
};
```

Under the hood, property accessors are based on getter/setter types.  Each of these inherits from the 'actual' data type, in this case `RectPtr`.  Proxy accessors only need a get() function returning a reference.  Value accessors use a get() function and optionally also a set() function.  Finally, we declare a union with property accessors using each of our getter/setter types.

Compared to using the macro, this approach provides more control over `const` semantics.  For example, we could choose to add a `const` qualifier to the `set` methods for accessing `width` and `height`.  This would allow 

```c++
#include <property_accessor_nomacros.h>

struct Virtual_Rect
{
    // The real data underlying the property accessor group.
    struct RectPtr {Rect *rect;};
    
    // Define reference-getters for proxy property accessors.
    struct acc_x1 : RectPtr {int& get() const {return rect->x1;}};
    struct acc_x2 : RectPtr {int& get() const {return rect->x2;}};
    struct acc_y1 : RectPtr {int& get() const {return rect->y1;}};
    struct acc_y2 : RectPtr {int& get() const {return rect->y2;}};

    // Define getter/setters for value property accessors.
    struct acc_width : RectPtr
    {
        int  get() const         {return rect->x2 - rect->x1;}
        void set(int new_width)  {rect->x2 = rect->x1 + new_width;}
    };
    struct acc_height : RectPtr
    {
        int  get() const         {return (rect->y2 - rect->y1);}
        void set(int new_height) {rect->y2 = rect->y1 + new_height;}
    };
    struct acc_area : RectPtr {int get() const {return rect->area();}};
    
    // Property accessors 
    union
    {
        // Give the real RectPtr structure a name so we can assign to it.
        RectPtr                       rect_ptr;
        
        // Proxy (reference) property accessors
        property_accessor<acc_x1>     x1;
        property_accessor<acc_x2>     x2;
        property_accessor<acc_y1>     y1;
        property_accessor<acc_y2>     y2;
        
        // Value (get/set by copy) property accessors
        property_accessor<acc_width>  width;
        property_accessor<acc_height> height;
        property_accessor<acc_area>   area;
    };
};
```

As a middle ground, it's also possible to use the `Custom` option in the `PropertyAccessors` macro.  This allows you to define your own `get` and `set` functions and handles the rest automatically.

The properties of the resulting class act like regular member variables of type `int`.  Math operators and other operator-based logic will work automatically:

```c++
void PrintVRect(const Virtual_Rect &vrect)
{
    // Properties support iostreams and acting as right-hand operands in general.
    std::cout << "VRect: {"
            << vrect.x1 << "," << vrect.y1 << ", "
            << vrect.x2 << "," << vrect.y2 << "} "
        << vrect.width << "x" << vrect.height << " = " << vrect.area
        << " ... width+height = " << (vrect.width+vrect.height) << std::endl;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    Rect rect = {0,2,  1,4};

    Virtual_Rect vrect = {&rect};

    PrintVRect(vrect);

    // We can manipulate width and height
    vrect.width += 2;
    vrect.height += 3;
    
    // We can't manipulate area because it's a get-only property.
    //vrect.area = 7;  <-- this line won't compile!

    PrintVRect(vrect);
}
```

Property accessors could also be added to the `Rect` object directly, giving it a richer function.  However, any variables used by property accessors need to exist in the underlying union.

It would be similarly possible to put these properties directly into `Rect`, except we would need to place its member variables inside the union with the properties that access them.

## Feature: Class Member Emulation

If a property accessor refers to a class, struct or union type, any member variables or methods of that class can be accessed with `->`.  In the case of value accessors, this uses a temporary copy of the property's value.

If we want properties that behave like class values instead of class pointers, we can use a specialization called a "mimic" to enable dot `.` access to listed members.  This specialization must be placed in the global namespace, and must be visible to any code declaring a property accessor using the type in question.  When possible, it's best to place our mimic declaration right after the type in question.

```c++
#include <property_accessor.h>

struct Rect
{
    int x1, x2, y1, y2;
    
    int area() const    {return (x2-x1) * (y2-y1);}
};

// Make Rect-type property accessors work more like the real thing.
PropertyAccess_Mimic(Rect,
    Variables(x1, y1, x2, y2),
    Methods(area));
```

We can specialize the mimic template ourselves.  The `property_access::member` template handles access to member variables.  When forwarding member functions, we use `_property_getset.get()` which returns either a value or reference depending on whether the specialization is applied to a proxy property or a value property.

Defining this class yourself provides more control over how forwarding methods are defined and enables some features that property accessors do not otherwise <mark>(currently)</mark> support:

* Member functions that mutate a value property.
* Explicitly-templated member functions, e.g. `get_component<TextComponent>()`
* Conversion operators.

```c++
#include <property_accessor_nomacros.h>

// Make Rect-type properties work more like the real thing.
namespace property_access
{
    template<typename GetSet_t> struct mimic<Rect, GetSet_t>
    {
        union
        {
            // This variable is required in any specialization of property_access::mimic.
            GetSet_t _property_getset;

            // These accessors automatically extend proxy or value access to Rect's members.
            property_access::member<GetSet_t, &Rect::x1> x1;
            property_access::member<GetSet_t, &Rect::y1> y1;
            property_access::member<GetSet_t, &Rect::x2> x2;
            property_access::member<GetSet_t, &Rect::y2> y2;
        };

        // Forward the area() method.
        int area() const    {return _property_getset.get().area();}
    };
}
```

</details>

We can even change mimicked variables on a get-set property.  In this case, a temporary copy of the property value will be made, its member variable will be changed, and the setter will be called with the modified property value.

## Operator Overloading

With just a few exceptions, property accessors will react to operators just like the value or reference they refer to.

These operators are supported by all property accessors:

â€‹    `() []  + - * / %  << >>  == != > >= < <=  ! ~ | & ^`

* **Proxy** accessors forward these operators to the referenced object.
* **Value** accessors apply these operators to the result of their `get` function.
  <mark>`set` is not invoked as these operators are not expected to modify the value.</mark>.
* C++23's multi-dimensional subscript operator is supported.

These operators are supported by proxy property accessors and *settable* value property accessors:

â€‹    `=  += -= *= /= %=  <<= >>=  &= |= ^=  ++ --`

* **Proxy** accessors forward any assignment or increment operators to the referenced object.

* **Value** accessors make a temporary value, assign or increment it, and invoke `set` with the modified value.

The following operators are not forwarded to destination values, for the reasons stated.

* `& ->*` â€” <mark>Support for forwarding these operators may be added in the future as use-cases become clearer.</mark>
* `* ->` â€” Used to dereference properties and access their values.  <mark>Support may be added if use-cases become clearer.</mark>
* `, && ||` â€” Rarely-used operators with a high likelihood of creating logic errors.  Support is not planned.
* `new delete new[] delete[]` â€” Property accessors should never be independently allocated or deleted.

### Const Correctness

Property accessors will preserve the `const` semantics of the getters and setters used to define them.

The `PropertyAccessors` macro declares all `get` functions const and all `set` functions non-const.  To make a settable property behave like a `mutable` member, you'll need to define its property 

There is some room for improvement with regard to const-correctness.  The predecessor to this library only supported proxy property accessors, so there is a tendency toward assuming const qualification.

<mark>In the case of value property accessors, operators other than assignments, compound assignments and increments will not invoke `set`.</mark>
